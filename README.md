# Config of Sketchybar ‚öúÔ∏è

Hi, this is my configuration of Sketchybar right now. 
I am simple, so I don`t have colors ü§ç for the background or the edge ‚ñ´Ô∏è. 
Just the icons, their configurations, and work. 

From this video [Sketchybar config](https://www.josean.com/posts/sketchybar-setup) 
I got the structure of Sketchybar and how to make the configuration. 
Also, the documentation [Sketchybar](https://felixkratz.github.io/SketchyBar/) is very useful for configuring the bar. 
I have yabai [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai) for window management. 
I added a timer üïô for pomodoro sessions to take this person's code.

I just made a couple of adjustments and chose the icon that corresponded to my icon pack. It's not finished yet; I plan to improve it.
